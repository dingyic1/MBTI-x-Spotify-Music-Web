# Motivation for the idea/description of the problem the application solves.
Our project is interested in exploring the datasets of songs and albums on Spotify. We would like to analyze the features of those songs and explore the underlying trends for each MBTI personality. More specifically, we want to create a website that could automatically recommend songs, albums, and artists for each personality type based on the analyzed results of the Spotify MBTI Playlists dataset. We would also like to enable users to search songs based on song features (which is not allowed on Spotify), such as danceability, energy, and tempo, on our website, and the website would return the corresponding songs, their links to the actual Spotify website, and their relevant information performed in a song card format.
