This is CIS 5500 Group 36 project 

# Motivation for the idea/description of the problem the application solves.
Our project is interested in exploring the datasets of songs and albums on Spotify. We would like to analyze the features of those songs and explore the underlying trends for each MBTI personality. More specifically, we want to create a website that could automatically recommend songs, albums, and artists for each personality type based on the analyzed results of the Spotify MBTI Playlists dataset. We would also like to enable users to search songs based on song features (which is not allowed on Spotify), such as danceability, energy, and tempo, on our website, and the website would return the corresponding songs, their links to the actual Spotify website, and their relevant information performed in a song card format. 

#SQL queries
1. Return the top 5 albums for each MBTI. For example, we want to find the 5 most relevant albums for ISTJ.
2. Return the top 5 artists for each MBTI. For example, we want to find the 5 most relevant artists for ISTJ.
3. Search tracks based on trackname, explicit, danceability, energy, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, time signature, mbti
4. Find a random song for each MBTI. For example, we want to find a random song for ISTJ.
5. Search a song and return similar song recommendations
6. Count the number of songs for each MBTI type for each artist
7. Count the number of songs for each MBTI type for each album
8. Show all artist's songs, corresponding MBTI type for each song, and release year for each song, ordered by release year
9. Search for an artist and return similar artists based on the features of the songs written by that artist.  
10. Show artist information along with number of songs
